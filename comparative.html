    <h1>App 1: ThinkUp</h1>
    <p>ThinkUp is designed as a tool for building a positive mindset using affirmations and self talk. While their interface is complex, there are two key features that stand out most. The first is on their practice panel, where you can play the audio of your recorded affirmations, with background music as well as an aesthetically soothing backdrop to create a feeling of calmness and safety. It’s interesting to note that the three smaller control buttons, for timer, music and volume settings are all premium features, which would most likely irk a user that is not satisfied with the default. The icons are simple and clean, and do not clash with the background, and even though the text is white against a light background, it is still visible with the drop shadows. 

    The second set of features, is on the stats panel, which shows you your current streak, total affirmations and total time. This is similar to one of Snapchat’s main features, and it is likely to increase users chances of returning to the app, so that they do not lose their streak. The psychological properties of colors tell us that blue is the color of the mind, and essentially very soothing, so it suits the purpose of this page well, as users want to feel calm and rewarded for building a good habit. The calendar is a smart feature which gives a macro visual representation for long term users to track their affirmation building habit over time.
    
    While the colors and content of the app are suitable, the size, spacing and alignment of the textual elements are a little crowded, making them difficult to read, especially for people with visual impairment. Some adjustments to the design will allow for more inclusivity and meet the needs of a broader user base.
