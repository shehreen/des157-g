    <h2>App 1: ThinkUp</h2>
    <img id="think" src="images/think.png">
    
    <p>ThinkUp is designed as a tool for building a positive mindset using affirmations and self talk. While their interface is complex, there are two key features that stand out most. The first is on their practice panel, where you can play the audio of your recorded affirmations, with background music as well as an aesthetically soothing backdrop to create a feeling of calmness and safety. It’s interesting to note that the three smaller control buttons, for timer, music and volume settings are all premium features, which would most likely irk a user that is not satisfied with the default. The icons are simple and clean, and do not clash with the background, and even though the text is white against a light background, it is still visible with the drop shadows.</p> 

    <p>The second set of features, is on the stats panel, which shows you your current streak, total affirmations and total time. This is similar to one of Snapchat’s main features, and it is likely to increase users chances of returning to the app, so that they do not lose their streak. The psychological properties of colors tell us that blue is the color of the mind, and essentially very soothing, so it suits the purpose of this page well, as users want to feel calm and rewarded for building a good habit. The calendar is a smart feature which gives a macro visual representation for long term users to track their affirmation building habit over time.</p>
    
    <p>While the colors and content of the app are suitable, the size, spacing and alignment of the textual elements are a little crowded, making them difficult to read, especially for people with visual impairment. Some adjustments to the design will allow for more inclusivity and meet the needs of a broader user base. 
    </p>
    
    <h2>App 2: Shine</h2>
    <img id="shine" src="images/shine.png">
    

    <p>
        Shine is an app that is promoted to make self-care easy. Similar to Sunny, it sends a motivational message to users every weekday morning, to help reduce stress, boost confidence, work smarter and more. Inside the interface, there are meditations, challenges and a journaling option. One main feature of the app is the conversational style daily check-in feature. You click on the “Read and Check-In” tab, and it opens up a chat box, where it sends you text messages, audio clips and cute graphics. After you go over the content, it prompts you to respond to whether you are ready for a “check in” and it asks you a series of questions regarding what you are doing now, how it is making you feel and what you have done today to feel good. After you type your responses, it sends you a congratulatory message with little fireworks using motion graphics, and begins your streak count.</p>

        <p>The color scheme of the app is primarily black and yellow, and then a range of soft pastel blue, green and pink hues. It has 5 tabs overall, which include the following: today, library, reflect, discuss and profile. Sunny similarly has tabs which include your saved quotes, shared quotes (garden) and your homepage. It also has a similar yellow focused color scheme, since the psychological properties of yellow are meant to lift our self-esteem and have an emotional impact, as its wavelength is long and essentially stimulating - it is a good choice for an app that is meant to help with emotional regulation with research backed techniques. Similar to Sunny, the app also has a social feature. Here you can post on the discussion board regarding your thoughts for the day, and people can send you love and cheers. While on ours, when you share a message to uplift your friend, it plants a flower in your garden, and over time, the garden is meant to show a visual representation of your mind as you tend to it. Overall, the features present in Shine are a good source of inspiration for Sunny.
