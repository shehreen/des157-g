  <h1>Virtual Collective Consciousness</h1>
  </header>

  <p>“Imagine the ability to vastly surpass the information processing constraints of our biological brains and share information via and interconnected group mind” (Barfod, 2018). Consciousness, is an essential aspect of human beings. Collective consciousness is a fundamental sociological concept, referring to a set of shared beliefs and knowledge common to a group. According to an article by Dr. Nicki Lisa Cole, “The collective consciousness informs our sense of belonging and identity, and our behavior”. The idea that with a group mind, we can get rid of ideologies that are nationalist, racist and xenophobic, would help us get rid of the “us” and “them” mentality that is commonly seen.
</p>
<p>The point of bringing up this topic is because while today’s society gets more advanced and fast paced thanks to the many technological feats of science, we are slowly changing how we operate as a collective society. While our individual perceptions are part of what makes life interesting and beautiful, who are we as a whole? “Would we be like the Borg from Star Trek with a hive mind? Capable of immense processing power but with no sense of individuality or compassion?” (Barfod, 2018).
</p>
<p>One of the ideas I am interested in delving further into is the power of meditation on global consciousness, and how technology and the developing virtual world can be incorporated into this raising of awareness of all human beings. The idea that collective intelligence can be positively manipulated to crowdsource solutions for solving pressing world issues - instead of pitting people and minds against one another because of politics and propaganda. By teaching people how to activate higher flow states of their being, and letting go of everything they were made to believe by people who didn’t really know any better themselves, mass media and deep cultural conditioning embedded in their genes.
</p>
<p>To help us thrive in a technology first age, I aim to come up with a framework for how virtual collective consciousness can help eliminate unnecessary phobias from the world and connect us all as human beings, through techniques that our ancestors used in ancient days, in a world that we hadn’t experienced, combined with concepts from modern science. The use of powerful tools we have at our disposal, such as meditation and even music, we can aim to find ways to slowly rewire our brains by exposing ourselves to a higher level of thought, beyond what we are able to comprehend in the physical world.
</p>
<p>This expansion of the mind, I hope, will lead to people realizing how unnecessary it is to feel the need to put someone else down, or engage in unnecessary arguments and political battles, and use our energy to save the planet, while simultaneously investing in ourselves and becoming happier, lighter and leading more fulfilling lives.</p>
