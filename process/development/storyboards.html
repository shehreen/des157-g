<p>The idea for this project is a mindfulness site, which can be accessed on mobile or desktop. In this scenario, a student is feeling anxious before going to school, because he has a tough day ahead. The next image on the top right depicts a student on her commute to school, scrolling through the internet and coming across the website, and reading advice on the feed and learning new insights that help her feel calmer and more grounded.</p>

<p>Feeling all positive and motivated on the inside after practicing some of the new techniques, just a few morning minutes for her mind made all the difference and she was ready to tackle the day. On top of that, she noticed her peers were going through similar struggles with anxiety, so she shared the tips that really worked for her and eventually shifted everyones mood as they learned how to be present and approach situations with love and patience. </p>
